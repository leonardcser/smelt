local HEAD = [[# Simplify: Code Review and Cleanup

Review all changed files for reuse, quality, and efficiency. Fix any issues
found.

## Phase 1: Identify Changes

Run `git diff` (or `git diff HEAD` if there are staged changes) to see what
changed. If there are no git changes, review the most recently modified files
that the user mentioned or that you edited earlier in this conversation.

## Phase 2: Launch Three Review Agents in Parallel

Use the agent tool to launch all three agents concurrently in a single message.
Pass each agent the full diff so it has the complete context.

### Agent 1: Code Reuse Review

For each change:

1. **Search for existing utilities and helpers** that could replace newly
   written code. Look for similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase — common
   locations are utility directories, shared modules, and files adjacent to the
   changed ones.
2. **Flag any new function that duplicates existing functionality.** Suggest the
   existing function to use instead.
3. **Flag any inline logic that could use an existing utility** — hand-rolled
   string manipulation, manual path handling, custom environment checks, ad-hoc
   type guards, and similar patterns are common candidates.

### Agent 2: Code Quality Review

Review the same changes for hacky patterns:

1. **Redundant state**: state that duplicates existing state, cached values that
   could be derived, observers/effects that could be direct calls
2. **Parameter sprawl**: adding new parameters to a function instead of
   generalizing or restructuring existing ones
3. **Copy-paste with slight variation**: near-duplicate code blocks that should
   be unified with a shared abstraction
4. **Leaky abstractions**: exposing internal details that should be
   encapsulated, or breaking existing abstraction boundaries
5. **Stringly-typed code**: using raw strings where constants, enums, or typed
   variants already exist in the codebase
6. **Unnecessary comments**: comments explaining WHAT the code does (well-named
   identifiers already do that), narrating the change, or referencing the
   task/caller — delete; keep only non-obvious WHY (hidden constraints, subtle
   invariants, workarounds)

### Agent 3: Efficiency Review

Review the same changes for efficiency:

1. **Unnecessary work**: redundant computations, repeated file reads, duplicate
   network/API calls, N+1 patterns
2. **Missed concurrency**: independent operations run sequentially when they
   could run in parallel
3. **Hot-path bloat**: new blocking work added to startup or
   per-request/per-render hot paths
4. **Recurring no-op updates**: state/store updates inside polling loops,
   intervals, or event handlers that fire unconditionally — add a
   change-detection guard so downstream consumers aren't notified when nothing
   changed
5. **Unnecessary existence checks**: pre-checking file/resource existence before
   operating (TOCTOU anti-pattern) — operate directly and handle the error
6. **Memory**: unbounded data structures, missing cleanup, event listener leaks
7. **Overly broad operations**: reading entire files when only a portion is
   needed, loading all items when filtering for one

## Phase 3: Fix Issues

Wait for all three agents to complete. Aggregate their findings and fix each
issue directly. If a finding is a false positive or not worth addressing, note
it and move on — do not argue with the finding, just skip it.

When done, briefly summarize what was fixed (or confirm the code was already
clean).

## Phase 2: Review the Changes

Work through the diff yourself across three concerns. Do not launch subagents.

### 1. Code Reuse

For each change:

- **Search for existing utilities and helpers** that could replace newly
  written code. Look for similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase — common
  locations are utility directories, shared modules, and files adjacent to the
  changed ones.
- **Flag any new function that duplicates existing functionality.** Note the
  existing function to use instead.
- **Flag any inline logic that could use an existing utility** — hand-rolled
  string manipulation, manual path handling, custom environment checks, ad-hoc
  type guards, and similar patterns are common candidates.

### 2. Code Quality

Review the same changes for hacky patterns:

- **Redundant state**: state that duplicates existing state, cached values that
  could be derived, observers/effects that could be direct calls
- **Parameter sprawl**: adding new parameters to a function instead of
  generalizing or restructuring existing ones
