# TUI Architecture — UI Framework Rewrite

## Implementation instructions

These directives govern how this plan is executed. They override defaults.

### Process

- **Stop at friction.** When something is unclear, when abstractions don't
  fit, when you're unsure which direction to take — stop and talk to the
  user. Present options, explain trade-offs, ask for a decision. Don't
  push through ambiguity. The cost of pausing is low; the cost of building
  the wrong abstraction is high.

- **The plan evolves.** This document is a living roadmap, not a contract.
  As implementation proceeds, new insights will surface — things we didn't
  anticipate when writing the plan. That's expected and good. Don't force
  the code to match the plan when the plan is wrong. Update the plan to
  match reality, then keep going.

- **Correct abstractions matter most.** The goal is not "get it done" but
  "get the abstractions right." Take inspiration from Neovim's architecture
  (buffers, windows, compositor, event dispatch) but adapt to Rust's
  ownership model. When in doubt, study how Neovim solves the problem and
  translate the concept, not the implementation.

- **No dead code annotations.** Never add `#[allow(dead_code)]`. Either
  use the code, remove it, or leave the compiler warning visible as a
  tracking marker for future work. Pre-existing `#[allow(dead_code)]` from
  earlier phases should be removed too.

- **Format, lint, test, commit as you go.** After each coherent change:
  `cargo fmt && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace`.
  Then update this plan (mark progress, record decisions), then commit.
  Don't batch — small, clean commits that each pass CI.

- **No throwaway work.** Don't build intermediate abstractions that will
  be discarded in a later phase. If the final architecture needs X, build
  toward X directly, even if incrementally. Every step should be a subset
  of the final state, not a detour.

- **Present multiple approaches.** When solving a problem, present options
  with pros/cons. Include the bold option (what would a clean rewrite look
  like?). Let the user choose the direction.

## Vision

Build a **retained-mode TUI rendering framework** (`crates/ui/`) inspired by
Neovim's architecture but designed for Rust's ownership model. The framework
provides a cell grid, compositor, and component system where every visible
surface is a window or component that draws into a grid region.

Three-layer architecture:

```
engine (core logic, no UI)
    ↕
ui (framework: grid, compositor, components, buffers, windows, layout)
    ↕
tui (terminal I/O: crossterm, event loop, app shell, Lua runtime)
```

The `ui` crate knows nothing about agents, engines, or protocols. The `tui`
crate is a thin app shell that wires `ui` primitives to smelt-specific logic
and handles terminal I/O. Both internal Rust code and Lua plugins talk through
the same `ui` API.

## Design principles

### Everything is a window (except the status bar)

Every interactive surface in the UI is a **window** backed by a **buffer**:

- **Transcript** — split window, readonly buffer, block content projected in
- **Prompt** — split window, editable buffer with vim motions
- **All dialogs** — float windows (help, confirm, resume, rewind, etc.)
- **BtwBlock** — float window (not a custom overlay)
- **Notifications** — ephemeral float window with auto-dismiss
- **Completions** — float window anchored to cursor position
- **Lua floats** — float windows created by plugins

The **status bar** is the only non-window surface — it's a single-row
component with no buffer, no scroll, no cursor. Making it a window would
force an abstraction that doesn't fit.

### One float dialog pattern

All dialogs follow the same visual structure:

```
┌─ Title ────────────────────┐
│                             │  ← scrollable content (BufferView)
│                             │
│  1. Option A                │  ← optional footer (ListSelect)
│  2. Option B                │
│                  [hints]    │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

Each dialog is a **configuration** of a single `FloatDialog` component, not
a separate implementation. The differences between dialogs are:

| Dialog      | Content                        | Footer              |
|-------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| Help        | Key binding table              | None (scroll only)   |
| Export      | 2 options                      | ListSelect           |
| Rewind      | Numbered turns                 | ListSelect           |
| Resume      | Filtered session list          | ListSelect + search  |
| Permissions | Section headers + entries      | ListSelect + delete  |
| Ps          | Process list                   | ListSelect + kill    |
| Agents list | Agent rows                     | ListSelect + detail  |
| Agent detail| Prompt + tool calls            | Scroll only          |
| Float (Lua) | Lines from Lua                 | Optional ListSelect  |
| Confirm     | Preview (diff/code/plan)       | ListSelect + textarea|
| Question    | Question text + options        | ListSelect + textarea|

### Shared rendering for diffs and code

Code diffs, syntax-highlighted files, and notebook previews render into
**buffers with highlights**. The same rendering code produces content for
both transcript blocks and confirm dialog previews. This means:

- Diffs in the transcript use the same code as diffs in confirm dialogs
- A confirm dialog's preview is an interactive buffer you can scroll through
- Lua plugins can create buffers with highlighted content using the same API

### Simplify question dialogs

The current question dialog has a complex tab system with `active_tab`,
`visited`, `answered`, `multi_toggles`, `other_areas`, `editing_other`.
Replace with a sequential wizard-style flow: one question per float,
advance to next on answer. Same visual pattern as every other dialog.

### Agent detail as separate float

The agents dialog currently has a two-mode design (list → detail with mode
switch). Replace with two separate floats: selecting an agent in the list
closes it and opens a detail float. Simpler state, no mode switching.

## Why not ratatui

We evaluated ratatui and decided against it:

- **Immediate mode vs retained.** Ratatui rebuilds the entire UI every frame.
  We want retained mode with dirty tracking.
- **No windows.** No concept of persistent viewports with cursor, scroll, focus.
- **No z-order.** Composites by render order only.
- **Abstraction clash.** Ratatui's `Buffer` = cell grid. Our `Buffer` = content model.

What we take: the cell grid concept as an intermediate rendering surface.

## Why a separate crate

- **Forces clean boundaries.** Can't import `protocol::Message` in `crates/ui/`.
- **Testable in isolation.** Unit-test grid, layout, components without an engine.
- **Reusable.** General TUI toolkit — not smelt-specific.
- **Makes the API surface explicit.** The `pub` items in `ui` *are* the API.

## Core architecture

### Cell Grid

2D array of `Cell { symbol, style }` between components and the terminal.
Components never emit escape sequences — they write cells to a grid region.
`GridSlice` is the Rust ownership adaptation: a borrowed rectangular view.

### Component

Retained rendering unit. Each UI surface implements `Component`:
- `draw()` — writes cells into its grid slice
- `handle_key()` — returns Consumed, Ignored, or Action(string)
- `cursor()` — cursor position if focused

### Compositor

Manages the component tree, orchestrates rendering, diffs frames.
Each frame: resolve layout → draw components → diff grids → emit SGR.

### Buffer (content model)

Lines + highlights + marks + virtual text + per-line decoration. Buffers
are the data model — windows read buffers and write cells to the grid.
Buffers are updated at event time (keystrokes, engine events, streaming),
not at render time.

Both editable and read-only buffers use the same type. The transcript is
a read-only buffer (`modifiable: false`) — it has the same keybindings
as a normal buffer (normal, visual, visual line, yank, scroll) except
insert mode. The prompt is an editable buffer.

Per-line decoration (`LineDecoration`) supports gutter backgrounds, fill
backgrounds, and soft-wrap markers. This is optional metadata — most
buffers don't use it, but the transcript and diff previews do. Highlight
spans carry optional `SpanMeta` for selection/copy behavior.

### Window

Viewport into a buffer with cursor, scroll, visual state. Windows are
components that read from their buffer during `draw()`. The app updates
buffers in response to events; windows pull from buffers when rendering.

This is the Neovim model adapted for Rust: events mutate buffers, buffers
mark their windows dirty, the compositor renders dirty windows.

### Naming conventions

Components implement `draw()` — the compositor calls `draw()` on each.
No per-component-type render methods (`render_dialog`, `render_prompt`).
App has one `render()` entry point that calls `compositor.render()`.
Temporary internal helpers during migration are prefixed with the
surface they handle but will be deleted once all surfaces are components.

### FloatDialog

Reusable component that composes BufferView + optional ListSelect + optional
TextInput. All dialogs are configurations of this component. Handles:
- Border + title chrome
- Scrollable content area (buffer view)
- Optional selectable footer (list select)
- Optional inline text input
- Common keys: scroll, dismiss (Esc), confirm (Enter)

### Layout

Region tree that positions split windows. Floats layer on top via z-index.

### Event dispatch

Focus chain: focused component → parent → global keymap → fallback.
Mouse events hit-test the layout tree.

| `Vim`                         | `Vim` (already in ui crate)                   |

## What stays in `tui`

- `App` struct, event loop, agent management
- Engine communication (`EngineHandle`, `UiCommand`, `EngineEvent`)
- `BlockHistory` + `StreamParser` + block rendering pipeline
- Session persistence
- Lua runtime + API bindings (calls through `ui::*`)
- Permission system
- Commands (slash commands are app-level, not framework-level)
- Terminal setup/teardown (raw mode, alternate screen, etc.)
- Dialog-specific logic (what content to show, what actions mean)

The `tui` crate calls `ui.render(&mut writer)` each frame. The block
rendering pipeline writes output into ui buffers. Dialog opening creates
a `FloatDialog` with appropriate content and footer configuration.

# Implementation phases

Each phase produces a working, compilable system. No phase breaks existing
functionality.

## Phase 0–2: Foundation (DONE)

Core types, text primitives, layout engine:
- `crates/ui/` with `BufId`, `WinId`, `Buffer`, `Window`, `Ui`
- Text primitives: `EditBuffer`, `Vim`, `KillRing`, `Cursor`, `Undo`
- Layout: `LayoutTree`, constraint solver, float resolution
- Buffer highlights: `Span`, `SpanStyle`, per-line styled content

## Phase 3–5: Grid + Components + FloatDialog (DONE)

Cell grid, compositor, primitive components, and unified dialog:
- `Grid`, `Cell`, `Style`, `GridSlice` — cell-level rendering surface
- `flush_diff()` — SGR emission from grid diffs
- `Component` trait — `draw()`, `handle_key()`, `cursor()`
  (no dirty flags — compositor always draws all layers, grid diff
  handles change detection at the cell level)
- `Compositor` — manages layers, orchestrates render, focus routing
- `BufferView` — renders buffer content with highlights and borders
- `ListSelect` — selectable list with indicators and navigation
- `TextInput` — single-line text editor with cursor
- `StatusBar` — left/right segmented status line
- `FloatDialog` — unified dialog composing BufferView + optional
  ListSelect footer + optional TextInput. All dialogs will be
  configurations of this single component. Supports border/title
  chrome, content/footer/input/hints layout, Tab focus cycling,
  vim-style scroll keys, and action-based key results
  (`select:N`, `dismiss`, `submit:text`).

## Phase 6: Buffer/window rendering model (IN PROGRESS)

**Goal:** Windows pull from buffers. App updates buffers at event time.
The render loop is just `compositor.render()`. Replace `RenderOut` +
`Frame` + the push-based data extraction pipeline with the Neovim-style
buffer/window model.

### Architecture

```
event (key, engine, timer)
    │
    ▼
App updates buffer content + marks window dirty
    │
    ▼
render tick
    │
    ▼
Compositor
├── TranscriptWindow  — reads from transcript buffer, draws into grid
├── PromptWindow      — reads from prompt buffer, draws into grid
├── StatusBar         — 1-row component (segments set at event time)
└── FloatDialog(s)    — float layers reading from their buffers
    │
    ▼
Grid diff → terminal
```

### Data flow (pull model)

Events update buffers. Windows read from buffers during draw.
The app's render function is minimal:

```rust
fn render(&mut self) {
    self.compositor.render(&mut stdout);
}
```

No data extraction step. No pushing snapshots into views. Buffers hold
the truth; windows render from it. This is the model that makes Lua
plugins natural — `buf_set_lines()` updates a buffer, the window
redraws automatically on the next frame.

### Transition from current state

The current code has a transitional `render_normal` function that
extracts data from `Screen`, pushes it into dumb view components,
then calls `compositor.render_with()`. This needs to be replaced:

**Step 1: Clean up current state** ✅ — fix dead code, remove
`#[allow(dead_code)]`, get everything compiling clean. Rename
`tick_*` methods to `render_*`.

**Step 2: Enrich `ui::Buffer` with line decoration** — add
`LineDecoration` (gutter_bg, fill_bg, fill_right_margin, soft_wrapped)
and `SpanMeta` (selectable, copy_as) to the buffer model. This makes
Buffer rich enough for both the transcript (read-only, decorated) and
the prompt (editable, plain). Update `BufferView` to render decorations.

**Step 3: Transcript buffer** — create a `ui::Buffer`-backed transcript.
The block rendering pipeline (`layout_block` → `DisplayBlock`) writes
into the buffer via `buf.set_lines()` + `buf.add_highlight()` +
`buf.set_line_decoration()` at event time (when blocks arrive, when
streaming appends). `TranscriptWindow` reads from this buffer in
`draw()`. App no longer extracts + pushes transcript lines each frame.

**Step 4: Prompt buffer** — move input state into a `ui::Buffer`.
`PromptWindow` reads from it in `draw()`. Keystrokes update the buffer
directly. The prompt chrome (notification bar, queued messages, bar info)
becomes virtual text or additional buffer content set at event time.

**Step 5: Status bar event-driven** — status bar segments are updated
when the underlying data changes (mode switch, new tokens, cost update),
not recomputed every frame.

**Step 6: Hollow out Screen** — as each piece moves into buffers,
`Screen` shrinks. Data that was in Screen moves to the buffer it
belongs to. Screen's draw methods are deleted as windows take over.

**Step 7: Migrate dialogs** — each of the 10 Dialog implementations
becomes a `FloatDialog` configuration added as a compositor layer.
Migration order (simplest first):
1. HelpDialog → FloatDialog with keybindings in buffer, no footer
2. ExportDialog → FloatDialog with 2-item ListSelect footer
3. RewindDialog → FloatDialog with turn list in ListSelect
4. FloatDialog (Lua) → FloatDialog with Lua content + optional footer
5. PermissionsDialog → FloatDialog with section content + ListSelect
6. PsDialog → FloatDialog with process list + ListSelect
7. ResumeDialog → FloatDialog with session list + search TextInput
8. AgentsDialog → Two FloatDialogs (list + detail)
9. QuestionDialog → Sequential FloatDialogs (one per question)
10. ConfirmDialog → FloatDialog with preview buffer + ListSelect + TextInput

Also migrate: BtwBlock, Notifications, Completions → float layers.

**Step 8: Delete legacy rendering** —
- `Dialog` trait, `DialogResult`, `ListState`, `TextArea`
- `Frame`, `RenderOut`, `StyleState` (SGR/style stack machinery)
- `paint_line` (legacy SGR paint path)
- `Screen::draw_viewport_frame`, `draw_viewport_dialog_frame`
- `active_dialog`, `open_dialog`, `finalize_dialog_close`
- All individual dialog structs in `render/dialogs/`
- `prompt_data.rs`, `status_data.rs` (transitional compute modules)
- `render_dialog`, `render_normal` (transitional dispatch methods)

### Current progress

Steps 1–3 complete:
- Step 1: Dead code cleanup, `tick_*` → `render_*` rename ✅
- Step 2: `ui::Buffer` enriched with `LineDecoration` and `SpanMeta` ✅
  BufferView renders gutter_bg, fill_bg, and decoration metadata.
- Step 3: Transcript buffer ✅ — `TranscriptProjection` projects
  blocks into a `ui::Buffer` (generation-gated). `TranscriptView`
  reads from the buffer via `BufferView.sync_from_buffer()`.
  Deleted: `collect_viewport`, `collect_transcript_data`,
  `paint_grid.rs`. `last_viewport_lines` still populated from
  projection for selection/cursor compat (to be removed when
  selection reads from buffer highlights directly).
- `PromptView` — component that paints pushed PromptRows ✅
  (needs to become a window reading from a buffer)
- `prompt_data.rs` — computes prompt data from Screen state ✅
  (transitional — will be replaced by event-driven buffer updates)
- `status_data.rs` — computes status segments from Screen state ✅
  (transitional — will be replaced by event-driven updates)
- Compositor wired into App, non-dialog frames render via grid diff ✅
- `BufId` and `Buffer::new` made public for cross-crate buffer creation ✅

Next: Step 4 — prompt buffer.

## Phase 7: Event dispatch

**Goal:** Input routing through component tree is framework-level.

- Compositor manages focus stack (z-index ordered for floats)
- `handle_key()` walks: focused → parent → global keymap
- `handle_mouse()` hit-tests layout → route to target
- Keymap system: buffer-local, window-local, global scopes
- Vim integration: vim state on windows, framework-level handling

## Phase 8: Lua bindings rewrite

**Goal:** Lua talks to `ui` directly. `smelt.api.buf/win` maps 1:1.

- Rewrite `lua.rs` buf/win sections to call ui API
- Lua creates buffers, opens float windows, sets content, adds highlights
- Remove `PendingOp::OpenFloat` / `UpdateFloat` / `CloseFloat`
- Port `btw.lua`, `predict.lua`, `plan_mode.lua` to clean API

## Phase 9: Cleanup and polish

**Goal:** Audit and finalize.

- Audit `pub` items in `ui` — hide internals
- Documentation: `docs/lua-api.md`, plugin authoring guide
- README update, full test suite pass

# Non-goals

- **Using ratatui.** Abstraction mismatch too large.
- **Plugin registry / package manager.** Lua scripts in `~/.config/smelt/`.
- **Remote UI protocol (v1).** Local terminal only.
- **Async Lua.** Sync-only; snapshot/queue pattern avoids borrow issues.
- **Full nvim compatibility.** We borrow the model, not the exact API.
- **Immediate mode.** We are retained mode with dirty tracking.

# Completed work

All prior phases (A–E, T1–T9, L1–L5.5) are complete. See git history.

Key outcomes:
- Alt-buffer rendering, top-relative coordinates, viewport pin
- Block rendering pipeline with layout caching
- Lua runtime with `smelt.api.*` surface, autocmds, user commands, keymaps
- `EngineSnapshot` / `PendingOp` snapshot/queue pattern

Phase 0–4 (ui crate):
- `crates/ui/` with core types, text primitives, layout engine
- Cell grid + style + SGR flush engine
- Component trait + Compositor (retained-mode rendering)
- BufferView, ListSelect, TextInput, StatusBar components
