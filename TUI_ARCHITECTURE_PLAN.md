# TUI Architecture Refactor Plan

## Goal

Reshape the TUI into a familiar editor-style architecture modeled on neovim — **buffers** (content + cursor + selection + buffer-local keymaps) inside **windows** (viewports with window-local keymaps and a layout rect), every interaction routed through a stable **public API** (`smelt::api::{buf, win, block, cmd, transcript, keymap, ui}`) — and expose that API to user configuration via **Lua bindings** (`mlua` + `~/.config/smelt/init.lua`).

The original code fought three problems at once: the content pane navigated a rendered projection instead of a model, coordinate systems / layout / freeze logic each lived in multiple places, and there was no shared vocabulary for "do this thing to that buffer/window." The nvim-style model + Lua FFI dissolves all three and yields an extensible platform.

## Why nvim vocabulary

- **Buffer = content** (text + undo + attachments + buffer-local keymap). Readonly or editable. Independent of on-screen presence.
- **Window = viewport onto a buffer** (rect + scroll + cursor + selection + optional vim state + window-local keymap). Multiple windows can show different buffers. Floating windows = windows with a non-docked rect.
- **Dialogs and completer are floating windows** — one primitive covers them all.
- **Keymaps layer** (`block → buffer → window → global`) so a transcript can have vim motions without the prompt inheriting them.
- **Public API** — internal code and Lua scripts share one surface. If the API expresses everything the app does, user Lua can extend anything the app can do.

## Guiding decisions

- Nvim-style names throughout: `Buffer`, `Window`, `TranscriptWindow`, `PromptWindow`, `curswant`, `cursor`, `api::buf::*`, `api::win::*`.
- Every state mutation goes through `smelt::api`. No direct `input.buf = …`, no direct `screen.active_* = …`. The API is the only door — Lua sees exactly what internal code sees.
- `BufId` / `WinId` / `BlockId` are stable opaque handles; Lua holds them by value. Mutation does not invalidate handles.
- Keep `BlockHistory`, `Vim`, content-addressed block layout caching. They are the good parts.
- **Cursor lives on the window, not the buffer.** `Window.cursor` is the canonical position (byte offset into its buffer's text). Display row/col is *derived* each frame from cursor + scroll + snapshot. Same buffer in two windows = two independent cursors.
- `TranscriptSnapshot` is the canonical derived view for the transcript window — cursor motion, selection, yank, click-hit-testing, scrollbar all read from it.
- **Top-relative coordinates everywhere.** Scroll = rows from the top of the transcript; cursor = absolute `(row, col)` in the snapshot. Bottom-relative math deletes itself.
- **Viewport pin, not freeze.** When the user is scrolled up, drag-selecting, or in vim visual, pin the top row to a fixed transcript row. New streaming output flows below off-screen; visible rows do not shift. Implemented by growing `scroll_offset` against a tracked total, not by skipping the paint.
- **Window-level gutters.** Left/right padding, scrollbar column, and any future number / sign / fold column are **window properties** rendered *around* the content rect. `content_rect = window.rect - gutters`. Cursor columns live in content-rect coords (cursor cannot enter a gutter — nvim's `numbercol` semantics). Clicks in gutters route to the gutter widget (scrollbar) or snap into content.
- **Span-level `SpanMeta` for in-block decorations** — diff markers, quote bars, tool-call indent. Cells carry `selectable: bool` + `copy_as: Option<String>`. Soft-wrap unwrap-on-copy uses per-row `logical_line: u32` so wrapped visual rows of one source line don't get `\n` inserted on copy.
- The `Window` trait describes only the shared surface. `PromptWindow` and `TranscriptWindow` stay structurally different where they need to be.
- Don't flatten `BlockHistory` into plain text. Snapshot *projects* it.
- One render path for normal mode. Scrollback `\r\n` stays only for headless fallback.
- **Alt-buffer is the only interactive rendering model.** Any code defending the old immutable-scrollback paradigm is dead weight; Phase A scrubs it.

```

## Public API (`smelt::api`)

One surface for internal callers, Lua scripts, and future out-of-process plugins.

```rust
// smelt::api::buf — text + undo + attachments
get_text / set_text / insert / delete
cursor / set_cursor / selection / yank
set_keymap

// smelt::api::win — viewport, per-window cursor, scroll, selection
list / current / set_current
buffer / rect / gutters / set_gutters
scroll / set_scroll_top / set_cursor
selection / extend_selection_to / clear_selection
set_keymap / focus_block

// smelt::api::block — per-block interactive model
status / set_status
view_state / set_view_state
append_text / rewrite / invoke(BlockAction)
push_streaming(block) -> BlockId
streaming_ids -> Vec<BlockId>
set_keymap

// smelt::api::transcript — transcript-level ops
snapshot(width) -> &TranscriptSnapshot
blocks / push / truncate
streaming_ids
clear

// smelt::api::cmd — user + plugin commands
register(name, handler)
run(line)                                          // ":quit", "/export file", "gg"
unregister(name)

// smelt::api::keymap — global bindings
set_global(chord, Action)

// smelt::api::ui — floats + notifications + mode
open_floating(FloatingSpec) -> WinId
open_completer(spec, anchor) -> WinId
close_window(WinId)
notify(msg) / notify_error(msg)
set_mode(Mode)

// smelt::api::autocmd — events (Lua consumers)
on(event, handler) -> AutocmdId
off(AutocmdId)
emit(event, payload)                               // internal code triggers these
```

Lookup order when a key fires: **block → buffer → window → global**. Matches nvim's `vim.keymap.set` + `buffer = N`.

`Action` is a small enum — `Cmd(String)`, `Motion(Motion)`, `Callback(LuaRef | RustFn)`. Commands go through `api::cmd::run`, so `":quit"` from Lua, from a keybind, or typed at the prompt all land in the same handler.

### Autocmd events (what Lua can subscribe to)

| Event           | Payload                               | When                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `key`           | `{ key, mods, buf, win }`             | Before dispatch                               |
| `cmd_pre`       | `{ name, args }`                      | Before command handler runs                   |
| `cmd_post`      | `{ name, args, result }`              | After command handler returns                 |
| `buf_enter`     | `{ buf, win }`                        | Focus moves to a buffer                       |
| `buf_leave`     | `{ buf, win }`                        | Focus leaves a buffer                         |
| `win_enter`     | `{ win }`                             | Window focus switch                           |
| `block_create`  | `{ block, kind }`                     | New block pushed                              |
| `block_change`  | `{ block, field }`                    | `rewrite` / `set_status` / `set_view_state`   |
| `stream_start`  | `{ block, kind }`                     | Status flipped to `Streaming`                 |
| `stream_end`    | `{ block, kind }`                     | Status flipped to `Done`                      |
| `selection`     | `{ win, start, end }`                 | Selection changes                             |
| `mode_change`   | `{ old, new }`                        | Agent mode / vim mode / app focus transitions |
| `resize`        | `{ width, height }`                   | Terminal resize                               |

## Shipped inventory

What's done so far, cross-referenced with the phases below.

- **Nvim-style renames** (Phase A prerequisite, done): `TextBuffer → Buffer`, `Pane → Window`, `ContentPane → TranscriptWindow`, `PaneId → WinId`, `pane` module → `window`, `content_pane` field → `transcript_window`.
- **`Window` trait filled out**: `cursor() / set_cursor()`, `scroll_top() / set_scroll_top()`, `selection() / clear_selection()`, shared by `TranscriptWindow` + `InputState`. `DerefMut for InputState` dropped.
- **`smelt::api` surface**: `buf::{get_text, replace}`, `win::{cursor, set_cursor, selection, clear_selection, scroll_top, set_scroll_top}`, `cmd::run`, `block::{view_state, set_view_state, status, set_status, push_streaming, rewrite, streaming_ids}`.
- **Mouse region unification** (Stage 6.5 shipped): `TranscriptRegion` + `ScrollbarGeom` + `TranscriptHit` recorded at paint time; `Screen::transcript_region()` exposes them; `InputRegion` carries its own `Option<ScrollbarGeom>`; both scrollbars share one `ScrollbarGeom::scroll_offset_for_row` hit-test; `transcript_dims` uses fresh total to drive pin math.
- **WindowCursor** (one type for prompt + transcript) carries `anchor` + `curswant`; `move_vertical(buf, cpos, delta)` is the single vertical-motion entry point.
- **Block primitives for mutable blocks (Stage 3.5 pre-req + core)**:
  - `BlockId` decoupled from content — monotonic per-session handle (cross-session cache sharing via `content_hash` field on `LayoutKey`).
  - `ViewState` + `Status` enums + per-block sparse maps.
  - `layout_block` honors `view_state` (Collapsed / TrimmedHead / TrimmedTail post-processing with elision marker).
  - `push_streaming`, `rewrite`, `streaming_block_ids` on `BlockHistory` + `Screen` + `api::block`.
  - `is_live()` centralizes "streaming blocks invisible in main paint path" across `render` / `paint_viewport` / `viewport_text` / `total_rows`.
- **Auto-pin when scrolled up**: transcript viewport pins on `scroll_offset > 0`, not just on selection/drag. Streaming rows grow below off-screen; visible content stays stable. Pin delta uses fresh `full_transcript_text.len()` each tick (no more stale `region.total_rows`).
- **Bottom-anchor transcript**: `paint_viewport` + `viewport_text` prepend leading blank rows when `total < viewport_rows` so the last content row sits at the viewport bottom — matches the cursor math and the `scroll_offset == 0 = stuck to bottom` convention.
- **Status bar consolidation**: buffer-agnostic `StatusPosition { line, col, scroll_pct }` pushed by `App::compute_status_position`; right-aligned via `align_right: bool` on `StatusSpan` + `cursor::MoveToColumn`; status bar carved out from click region (row `h-1` swallows mouse events).
- **Streaming-safe input routing**: `handle_event_idle` + `handle_event_running` share one `dispatch_common` preamble (mouse, pane chord, content-focus routing, overlay keys). Focus switch, click, drag-select all work mid-stream.
- **Prompt prediction cursor gated on focus** — no more double-cursor when focus is on the transcript.
- **Curswant seeded on click** (both prompt and transcript), and on `refocus`.
- **Stage 3 command bus scaffold**: `api::cmd::run` is the single entry point; `Outcome = CommandAction` is the stable result shape. Registry lookup still matches legacy `App::handle_command` — migration is mechanical.

## Known bugs to fix during Phase B

- **`j`/`k` locked on resume until first click** — intermittent; likely cpos/curswant/vim-state seeding split across `refocus` + `mount` + `sync_from_cpos`.
- **Click hit-test offset inverted on short buffers** — `position_content_cursor_from_hit` doesn't account for the bottom-anchor leading blanks added in `paint_viewport`. Clicking top of viewport maps to wrong line.

Both fall out of Phase B's `ViewportGeom` centralization.

# Phased plan

Five phases. Each is shippable. Each phase lists what it **deletes** alongside what it adds.

## Phase A — Paradigm cleanup: purge terminal-scrollback-era code

The scrollback-commit rendering model is dead. Alt-buffer repaints every frame; there is no terminal-side scrollback that can drift. Every abstraction that defended the old invariants is dead weight and has to go before anything else. This phase deletes, it doesn't add.

**Status**
- ✅ **A2** (PurgeRedraw): fully shipped.
- ✅ **A3** (commit/flush/scroll-mode vocabulary): `BlockHistory::render`, `flushed`-counter gating, `last_block_rows`, `suppress_leading_gap`, `pending_head_skip`, `scroll_up`, scroll-mode `newline` branch — all deleted. `paint_viewport` is the only block painter.
- ✅ **A4** (obsolete tests): shipped.
- ✅ **A5**: `draw_frame` fully deleted. `tick_dialog` → `draw_viewport_dialog_frame` (alt-buffer, reserves `dialog_height + 1 gap + 1 status` at the bottom of the viewport). `draw_prompt` + the one unit-test caller route through `draw_viewport_frame`.
- ⚠️ **A1 partial**: `active_exec` and `active_thinking` now flow through streaming `Block::Exec` / `Block::Thinking` via `push` + `rewrite` + `set_status(Done)`. `Element::ActiveExec`, `render_active_exec`, and the `ActiveExec` struct are deleted. `active_text`, `active_tools`, `active_agents` still live in `render_ephemeral_into`; `has_ephemeral` + `extra_lines` stay until those three migrate. The animated thinking-summary widget (shown when `show_thinking == false`) deliberately remains as an ephemeral overlay — it's a summary, not a stream.

### A1 — Atomic `active_*` → `Streaming` blocks cutover

Do all five `active_*` migrations in **one** coherent patch, not per-variant dual-write.

- Remove `active_text`, `active_thinking`, `active_tools`, `active_exec`, `active_agents` from `Screen`.
- At stream start: `api::block::push_streaming(block)` → hold the returned `BlockId`.
- On chunks: `api::block::rewrite(id, new_block)` or `api::block::append_text(id, chunk)`.
- On commit: `api::block::set_status(id, Done)`.
- Delete `Screen::render_ephemeral_into`.
- Delete `extra_lines` parameter from `paint_viewport`, `viewport_text`, `total_rows`.
- Delete `has_ephemeral()`.
- `Transcript::streaming_ids()` replaces all `self.active_*.is_some() / iter()` readers.
- `is_live()` stops skipping Streaming blocks in paint — Streaming = normal-painted, just with a "live" style flag.

**Deletes**: `active_*` fields, `render_ephemeral_into`, `has_ephemeral`, `extra_lines`, "live = overlay, committed = history" mental model, dual-storage for one logical stream.

### A2 — Remove `Ctrl+L` purge/redraw debounce

- `Action::PurgeRedraw`, `App::purge_redraw_debounced`, `App::last_purge_redraw`, `PURGE_REDRAW_DEBOUNCE` all go.
- `Screen::redraw`'s `Clear::All` goes.
- Ctrl+L handler collapses to `screen.mark_dirty()`.

**Deletes**: ~100 lines of anti-tearing gymnastics that the alt buffer makes irrelevant.

### A3 — Drop "commit" vocabulary + scrollback newlining

- Rename / inline `commit_exec`, `commit_active_tools`, `flush`, `flushed` counter, `last_block_rows`.
- `scroll_newline` vs `overlay_newline` bifurcation in `RenderOut` — overlay is the only path that ships; scrollback newline retained only for headless fallback under `cfg(test)` or a flag.
- `RenderOut::row: Option<u16>` "overlay vs scroll mode" branch collapses — always overlay in interactive mode.
- `pending_head_skip`, `suppress_leading_gap`, `BlockHistory::has_unflushed` — all artifacts of partial-commit rendering. Delete.

**Deletes**: `BlockHistory::flushed`, `last_block_rows`, `pending_head_skip`, `suppress_leading_gap`, scroll-mode `RenderOut` branches, `commit_*` naming.

### A4 — Delete obsolete tests

- Scrollback-integrity "no duplicate row" suite: invariants meaningless under alt-buffer.
- Overlay-edge-cases committed-history resize tests: assertion shape is wrong for the model.
- Any test that asserts "line X appears exactly once in the combined paint stream."
- 9 already removed; audit for more.

**Deletes**: tests defending dead invariants.

### A5 — Clean up `draw_frame` vs `draw_viewport_frame`

- `draw_viewport_frame` becomes the only normal-mode entry. `draw_frame` retained only under `#[cfg(test)]` + headless-capture.
- One `if is_dialog` branch collapses.

**Deletes**: normal-mode dual-paint path, ~200 lines.

**Phase A done when**: `Screen` has no `active_*`, no `render_ephemeral_into`, no `extra_lines`, no `PurgeRedraw`, no "flush" counter, no scroll-mode newlining in normal paint. Every block renders through one path; every stream mutates blocks in place.

---

## Phase B — Centralize viewport/cursor/scroll geometry

**Status**
- ✅ **B1**: `render/viewport.rs` ships `ViewportGeom` with `max_scroll` / `clamped_scroll` / `skip_from_top` / `leading_blanks` / `row_of_line` / `line_of_row` / `stuck_to_bottom` / `apply_growth` and 8 unit tests covering the boundary matrix (short buffer, exact fit, overflow stuck-to-bottom, mid-scroll, scroll-past-max, growth preserves pin, growth while stuck, empty buffer).
- ✅ **B3 partial**: `BlockHistory::paint_viewport` and `BlockHistory::viewport_text` both consume `ViewportGeom` for scroll/skip/leading-blank math — the two hottest paths no longer reinvent the mapping.
- ⬜ **B3 remainder**: `TranscriptWindow::{sync_from_cpos, visible_cpos, mount, reanchor_to_visible_row, apply_pin}` still open-code the math. `events.rs::position_content_cursor_from_hit` still uses `skip + rel_row`.
- ⬜ **B4**: the two cursor bugs (j/k locked on resume; click offset inverted on short buffers) have not been verified or regression-tested yet.


Four cursor/scroll bugs this session all had the same shape: the mapping `(viewport_rows, total, scroll_offset) ↔ (row_on_screen, line_in_buffer)` was reinvented at each call site. Centralize.

### B1 — New `render/viewport.rs` module

```rust
pub struct ViewportGeom {
    pub total:          u16,                       // rows in the flattened buffer
    pub viewport_rows:  u16,                       // visible rows
    pub scroll_offset:  u16,                       // rows from the bottom (alt-buffer convention)
    pub leading_blanks: u16,                       // viewport.saturating_sub(total), for bottom-anchoring
}

impl ViewportGeom {
    pub fn max_scroll(&self) -> u16;
    pub fn clamped_scroll(&self) -> u16;
    pub fn skip_from_top(&self) -> u16;            // lines to skip before painting
    pub fn row_of_line(&self, line_idx: u16) -> Option<u16>;   // None if offscreen
    pub fn line_of_row(&self, row: u16) -> Option<u16>;        // None if in leading blank
    pub fn cursor_row(&self, cursor_line: u16) -> u16;         // bottom-anchored
    pub fn apply_growth(&mut self, delta: u16);                // pin math
    pub fn stuck_to_bottom(&self) -> bool;
}
```

- Every paint path + every hit-test + every cursor placement consumes this.
- No more open-coded `viewport_rows.saturating_sub(1 + line)` or `total.saturating_sub(viewport).saturating_sub(scroll)`.
- `apply_growth` replaces the `pinned_last_total` delta dance.

### B2 — Unit tests lock down the invariants

Matrix: total ∈ {0, 1, viewport-1, viewport, viewport+1, 2·viewport}, scroll ∈ {0, 1, max-1, max, max+1}, line ∈ {0, total-1, total}. Every cell of the matrix has an expected `row_of_line` / `line_of_row` / `cursor_row`.

### B3 — Migrate call sites

- `TranscriptWindow::sync_from_cpos` / `visible_cpos` / `mount` / `reanchor_to_visible_row` — read from `ViewportGeom`.
- `BlockHistory::paint_viewport` / `viewport_text` — consume the geom's `leading_blanks` + `skip_from_top`.
- `events.rs::position_content_cursor_from_hit` — `geom.line_of_row(rel_row)` instead of `skip + rel_row`.
- `app/events.rs::sync_transcript_pin` / `apply_pin` — `geom.apply_growth(delta)`.

### B4 — Fix the two known cursor bugs as a side effect

- **j/k locked on resume**: trace through `refocus` → `mount` → `sync_from_cpos` with geom in place. Curswant + cpos seed order becomes one call into the geom.
- **Click offset inverted on short buffers**: `line_of_row(row)` accounts for `leading_blanks` automatically.

**Deletes**: open-coded viewport math in 6+ call sites; `pinned_last_total` as a magic number; the implicit "bottom-relative" convention (becomes an explicit type).

**Phase B done when**: `grep "viewport_rows.saturating_sub" crates/tui/src` returns nothing outside `viewport.rs`. Both known cursor bugs fixed by unit test.

---

## Phase C — API surface lockdown

With paradigm cleanup done and geometry stable, the remaining surface is what Lua will bind to. Make it clean and final *before* shipping Lua.

### C1 — Extract `Transcript` from `Screen`

- `Transcript` owns `BlockStore` + `Vec<BlockId>` + the transcript `BufId` + a `TranscriptSnapshot` cache.
- `Screen` becomes pure UI chrome: prompt paint, status bar, dialog layout, frame composition.
- `Transcript` is unit-testable without `Screen` — snapshot tests, view_state tests, streaming tests all run in microseconds with no TTY harness.
- Engine event handlers call `api::block::*` / `api::transcript::*` instead of `self.screen.append_text` etc.

**Deletes**: `Screen` as domain owner; direct `self.screen.active_*` was already gone in Phase A; now `self.screen.push_text` goes too.

### C2 — `TranscriptSnapshot` + top-relative coords + `SpanMeta`

```rust
struct SpanMeta {
    selectable: bool,
    copy_as:    Option<String>,                    // None = emit char; Some("") = skip; Some(s) = substitute
    action:     Option<BlockAction>,               // clickable cell
}

struct DisplayCell { ch: char, style: Style, meta: SpanMeta }
struct DisplayRow  { cells: Vec<DisplayCell>, logical_line: u32 }

struct TranscriptSnapshot {
    width:            u16,
    rows:             Vec<DisplayRow>,
    logical:          String,
    cell_to_logical:  Vec<Vec<Option<usize>>>,
    logical_to_cell:  Vec<(u16, u16)>,
    block_of_row:     Vec<BlockId>,
    row_of_block:     HashMap<BlockId, Range<u16>>,
}
```

- `Transcript::snapshot(width)` — cached, invalidated on width or block mutation.
- `TranscriptWindow` navigates snapshot `(row, col)` coords; vim line-motions use `logical` via the mapping.
- Top-relative: `scroll_top_row: u16` (top of viewport is this snapshot row). "Stuck to bottom" is `scroll_top_row == snapshot.rows.len() - viewport_rows`.
- `snapshot.copy_range(sel_start, sel_end) -> String` is the single copy primitive.
- `snapshot.snap_to_selectable((row, col))` for cursor placement.
- `snapshot.block_of_row[row]` for O(1) "which block owns this row" — mouse dispatch reads this directly.

**Deletes**: `full_transcript_text`, `viewport_text`, `last_viewport_text`, `rows.join("\n")` inside `TranscriptWindow::mount`, bottom-relative `scroll_offset` (becomes derived), all three coord conversions, viewport-relative visual-selection remap in `events.rs`.

### C3 — Window-level gutters (task #26)

- `WindowGutters { pad_left, pad_right, scrollbar: Option<Side> }` on every `Window`.
- `content_rect(window) = window.rect - gutters`.
- Cursor / selection / click-hit-test / snapshot rendering all in content-rect coords.
- Gutter painting is the renderer's job; buffer code never thinks about gutters.
- Scrollbar column fits inside `pad_right` (or `pad_left` if scrollbar = Left).
- Future `numbercol_width`, `signcol_width`, `foldcol_width` slot in without call-site changes.

### C4 — Keymap layering (block → buffer → window → global)

- Each buffer, window, and block has its own `Keymap`. Lookup in order.
- Transcript buffer ships with vim motions at buffer scope (`h/j/k/l`, `v`, `y`, `gg`, `G`). Prompt buffer ships with editor bindings.
- Transcript window ships with scroll bindings (`Ctrl-U/D/F/B/Y/E`) at window scope.
- Focused block can override keys (e.g. tool block binds `e` to expand, `r` to re-run).
- `Ctrl-W` window navigation, `Ctrl-L` redraw, `Ctrl-C` interrupt at global scope.

**Deletes**: hardcoded `if window is content then route through vim` branches; `KeyAction::Cmd` vs `Action::Motion` divergence at dispatch (both through one chain).

### C5 — Completer + dialogs as floating windows

- `Completer` keeps its fuzzy engine, renders into a floating window. Two mount sites (above prompt, over status).
- Floats don't shift dock rects — overlay only.
- Dialogs become floating windows with `modal = true`; dispatcher routes to top modal first.
- `api::ui::open_floating(spec)` / `open_completer(spec, anchor)` are the entry points.

**Deletes**: `Dialog` trait as a distinct concept; per-completer render code; "dialog intercepts events" special case.

### C6 — Selectable regions + unwrap-on-copy

- Left/right viewport padding → `selectable: false, copy_as: Some("")`.
- Soft-wrap continuation: shared `logical_line`, no `\n` between on copy.
- Hard newlines: different `logical_line`, `\n` on copy.
- Diff gutter `+/-/ `, quote bar `│`, tool-call indent, line-number column → `selectable: false` with appropriate `copy_as`.
- `snapshot.copy_range()` walks cells emitting `copy_as` or `ch` or nothing.

**Deletes**: bare `copy_to_clipboard(&buf[s..e])` in `copy_content_selection_and_clear`; selection-range translation through `rows.join("\n")`.

### C7 — Unified selection / cursor / scrollbar renderers

- One `Selection` view on a window (vim visual if present, else shift anchor).
- `render::cursor(&dyn Window, &Snapshot, &LayoutState)` and `render::scrollbar(&dyn Window, &LayoutState)` — shared.
- `api::win::extend_selection_to(pos)` replaces the `extend_content_selection_to` / `extend_prompt_selection_to` split.

**Deletes**: duplicated selection priority; per-window scrollbar paint; separate `draw_soft_cursor` call sites.

### C8 — Layout primitive (`LayoutState` + `WindowRect`)

- `WindowRect::{Dock(Region), Float { rect, z, anchor }}`.
- Compositor produces `LayoutState` per frame from rects + dock priorities.
- Mouse handlers read `LayoutState` (z-ordered hit-test walks floats first).

**Deletes**: `Screen::input_region` as a method; `prev_prompt_rows`; `viewport_rows_estimate`; bespoke dialog rect math.

### C9 — Semantic intents for mouse/wheel

- `PaneIntent::{Scroll, MoveCursor, BeginSelection, ExtendSelection, YankSelection}`.
- Wheel handlers call `api::win::scroll` directly; no synthetic `KeyCode::Char('j')`.

**Deletes**: `Buffer::press_n`; `scroll_prompt_by_lines`'s synthetic-key loop.

### C10 — Freeze + document `api::*`

- Freeze public signatures. Every `pub fn` in `api::` gets a doc comment that will render as user-facing docs.
- `smelt.api.version = "1"` constant. Future breaking changes bump it; Lua can branch.
- One-page API reference generated from doc comments.

**Phase C done when**: `Transcript` is unit-testable without `Screen`; `State` is unit-testable without a terminal; no coord-system conversion; every mutation goes through `api::*`; one selection rule, one cursor renderer, one scrollbar renderer; one-page API doc exists.

---

## Phase D — Lua bindings (mlua)

`api::*` is stable. Wire it to Lua.

### D1 — mlua bootstrap

- Add `mlua` crate (Lua 5.4; feature `send` if multi-thread, `vendored` for hermetic build).
- `LuaRuntime` lives on `State`. Loads `~/.config/smelt/init.lua` at startup.
- Errors in `init.lua` surface as a notification + deferred dialog; app keeps running with default config.
- Lua sandbox: no `io.*`, no `os.execute`, no `package.loadlib` (configurable — default locked down).

### D2 — Shim `api::*` as Lua tables

One file (`lua/bindings.rs`), one `register_fn!` call per Rust `pub fn`. Mechanical.

```lua
-- ~/.config/smelt/init.lua example
smelt.keymap("n", "<C-g>", function()
  smelt.api.win.set_cursor(0, 0)                   -- gg equivalent
end)

smelt.cmd.register("double_compact", function(args)
  smelt.api.cmd.run("compact")
  smelt.api.cmd.run("compact")
end)

smelt.on("block_change", function(ev)
  if ev.field == "status" and ev.status == "Done" then
    smelt.notify("block " .. ev.block .. " finished")
  end
end)
```

### D3 — Autocmd dispatch

- `AutocmdRegistry { events: HashMap<EventKind, Vec<(AutocmdId, LuaRef)>> }`.
- Emission points in Rust (`api::autocmd::emit(event, payload)`) at every `*_change` / `*_enter` / `*_leave` / `stream_start` / `stream_end` / `key` / `cmd_pre` / `cmd_post`.
- Dispatch is synchronous; Lua errors caught, logged, next handler runs.
- Event table documented (see list above).

### D4 — User-command + keymap registration from Lua

- `smelt.cmd.register(name, fn)` → calls `api::cmd::register` with a Rust-side adapter that calls `lua.call(ref, args)`.
- `smelt.keymap(mode, chord, fn_or_cmd)` → calls `api::keymap::set_global` (or `set_buffer` / `set_window` with scope arg).
- Handlers live as `LuaRef`; dropped when user re-sources config or calls `unregister`.

### D5 — Re-entrancy + event loop integration

- Lua callbacks run on the main thread, synchronously with the dispatching event.
- Mutations inside callbacks (e.g. `api::buf::insert` from `on("key", ...)`) are queued as pending ops, applied after the dispatching handler returns — prevents mid-event state corruption.
- No async in v1. Scheduled callbacks use a simple `smelt.defer(ms, fn)` that posts to the tick loop.

### D6 — Lua error surfacing UX

- `init.lua` syntax errors → startup notification + dialog with the traceback. App runs with default config.
- Runtime errors in callbacks → logged to `~/.cache/smelt/lua.log` + notification. Handler is marked dead so it doesn't spam on repeat.
- `:lua <expr>` command for live evaluation (debug helper).

**Deletes**: nothing — this phase is purely additive.

**Phase D done when**: `init.lua` can register user commands, bind keys, subscribe to events, and drive mutations through the API. Errors don't crash.

---

## Phase E — Dogfood

Validate the API by porting existing features *through* it.

### E1 — Move slash commands to Lua

- `/rewind`, `/export`, `/help`, `/model`, `/compact` etc. register via `smelt.cmd.register` in a shipped `init.lua` that defaults to the current behavior.
- Users can override by redefining in their own config.
- Exposes gaps: any command that can't be expressed through `api::*` is a Phase C bug report.

### E2 — Built-in keybinds become Lua

- Default keymap config shipped as Lua. Users can rebind or disable without touching Rust.
- Block keymaps (tool expand/collapse/re-run) via `smelt.api.block.set_keymap`.

### E3 — Example plugins

- Ship one or two example plugins under `docs/lua-examples/`:
  - Vim-style custom leader keymap
  - Block summarizer (collapse long tool output by default)
  - Per-project config (load `smelt.lua` from `$PWD/.smelt/` if present)

**Phase E done when**: any existing user-visible feature is reimplementable as pure Lua. Gaps surfaced here close Phase C.

---

## Explicit non-goals

- **Flattening `BlockHistory` into plain text.** Structure is load-bearing.
- **Unifying prompt and transcript under one monolithic window type.** Shared trait + per-role structs.
- **One big-bang rewrite.** Each phase ships.
- **Plugin loader / manifest / sandboxing beyond mlua's defaults.** Lua scripts live in `~/.config/smelt/`; no registry.
- **Async Lua.** v1 is sync-only; coroutines possible later.
- **Deleting `draw_frame` entirely.** Headless mode still needs scrollback output.
- **Forcing structural symmetry between windows.**
- **Moving freeze into the model.** Freeze is "don't repaint"; model is always current.

## Success criteria

- Adding a new window type is: implement `Window`, register keymaps via `api::win::set_keymap`. No changes to `State`, `Screen`, or dispatch core.
- Adding a new completer use-case: build a `CompleterSpec`, call `api::ui::open_completer`. No new render code.
- Adding a new command: `api::cmd::register(name, handler)` — reachable from keybinds, `:cmd`, and Lua.
- Adding a non-selectable UI element (gutter, decoration, line number): `selectable: false` on the span. Nothing else changes.
- Adding a Lua hook into any existing feature: one `smelt.on(event, fn)` call. No Rust changes.
- No function converts between bottom-relative and top-relative coordinates.
- No mutation bypasses `api::*`.
- `Transcript`, `State`, every primitive is unit-testable without a terminal.
- Viewport/cursor math has a unit test matrix that covers the full space of `(total, viewport, scroll, line)`.
- `smelt.api.*` surface documents to one page and is stable across minor versions.
- Users can redefine every default keybind and built-in slash command in Lua without touching Rust.

## Recommended sequencing

**A → B → C → D → E.** Two checkpoints make sense as release candidates:

- **After Phase B**: paradigm clean, math stable. Code is much smaller and correct-by-construction. Materially better system on its own even if Lua never lands.
- **After Phase C**: API stable, documented. First private alpha of `api::*` possible here for out-of-process bindings.
- **After Phase D**: Lua ships.
- **After Phase E**: Lua ecosystem opens.

Phases are not strictly blocking — e.g. some Phase C items (gutters, completer-as-float) can start while Phase B's geom module is being tested. Anything that doesn't touch the viewport/cursor math can parallelize freely.
