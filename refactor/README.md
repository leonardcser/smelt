# refactor/ — start here

Entry point for the smelt rebuild. Short by design. Re-read every few sessions.
If you're new to this — including future-you in two weeks — this is your map.

## What this is

A multi-phase rewrite of smelt's Rust + Lua surface to the target shape in
`tui-ui-architecture-target.puml`. Greenfield: no users, no migration story, no
backward compatibility. The only artefact that matters is the final shape.

## The plan is not final

This is the most important rule. **Every `refactor/` doc is a sketch, not a
contract** — the sequencing in `REFACTOR.md`, the intent in
`ARCHITECTURE.md`, the structure in the puml diagram (and its rendered SVG),
the file fates in `INVENTORY.md`, the parity rows in `FEATURES.md`, the test
strategy in `TESTING.md`, the vertical slice in `TRACE.md`, the historical
log in `DECISIONS.md`. Reality will push back on all of them. We absolutely
have not thought of everything. There are decisions in these docs that will
turn out wrong, sub-phases that need to split or merge, abstractions that
look elegant on paper and ugly in code, module boundaries that don't draw
the seam where the seam wants to be, type shapes that need different fields,
events that need to fire at different points, and better designs you'll see
only once you have a file open.

When that happens:

- **Take the better path.** Don't follow the doc to the letter when a better way
  is plain. Update the docs in the same change. Log the decision in `P<n>.md`.
  The diagram and these docs are canonical for _current intent_; both can
  change.
- **Stop and ask** when the friction wants a user-visible behavior change you
  didn't agree to, or when two designs are equally defensible and you can't
  decide alone.

Bias toward decisive action when the right answer is plain; toward pausing when
it isn't. Either path ends with the docs updated.

## How we work through phases

- **A red tree is fine inside a phase.** No migration shims, no parallel "kept
  for now" implementations, no compat layers. A larger diff that lands the tree
  in its final shape beats a chain of small diffs that leave it half-migrated.
  We require green only at phase boundaries.
- **No feature gets dropped.** The UX changes shape; it doesn't shrink.
  `FEATURES.md` is the parity checklist — walk it at each phase boundary. If a
  phase deletes code and a feature isn't reachable in the new shape, the phase
  isn't done.
- **No throwaway scaffolding.** When a step rewrites a thing, the old thing goes
  in the same change.
- **Decide while coding.** When two designs feel close, pick one in the diff,
  don't pre-plan it here. Document what you picked in `P<n>.md` if you'd
  re-litigate it later.
- **No step is too big.** If a phase wants to delete 30 files and replace them,
  that's a phase.
- **Diagram is the spec for structure.** The puml is canonical for shape;
  touching it means updating `REFACTOR.md` (and regenerating the SVG) in the
  same diff. Drift is a bug, not a tiebreaker.
- **Code stays phase-agnostic.** The code itself never references `P0` /
  `pre-P0` / `P3.b` / "L2" or any other refactor-stage label — not in
  comments, not in identifiers, not in test names, not in commit messages
  beyond the `P<n>.md` log itself. Phase context lives in `P<n>.md`, the
  `refactor/` docs, and PR descriptions. Source reads as if the new shape
  was always there. (Same spirit as the global "no traces of what came
  before" refactor rule.)
  - **Carve-out for TODOs.** `TODO(P<n>): <action>` is allowed at the
    call site to mark "blocked until phase Pn lands the prerequisite."
    Doing the work removes the TODO; no other doc needs touching. Keep
    the action concrete (`TODO: mount Anthropic SSE cassette`) — never
    a lament (`TODO: this is broken`).
  - **No `TODO.md`.** Code-coupled deferrals live as TODOs at the call
    site. Cross-cutting open questions live in `STATUS.md`; phase-slipped
    work lives in `P<n>.md` "Deferrals"; per-file fates live in
    `INVENTORY.md`. A separate TODO list would drift and duplicate.

## Don't stop until done or blocked

A green tree + a sub-phase landed isn't a stop point — it's a milestone.
After landing one piece, immediately pick up the next from `STATUS.md`
without waiting for confirmation. Auto mode in particular treats "what's
next?" as the default action, not a question.

Stop only when:

- A design choice is genuinely ambiguous and two paths are equally
  defensible. Capture the options in `STATUS.md` and ask.
- The next step would require a user-visible behavior change that wasn't
  in scope. Confirm first.
- A real external blocker appears (missing credentials, env mismatches,
  decisions only the user can make).

A "finished task" means: tests pass, clippy clean, `refactor/check.sh`
green, docs synced (`P<n>.md` / `STATUS.md` / `INVENTORY.md`), and the
next task on `STATUS.md` picked up. Anything short of that is mid-task.

## Re-orient on every task

Even mid-session, before starting a new task or sub-phase: re-read
`STATUS.md`, the most recent `P<n>.md`, and any `INVENTORY.md` rows for
files you'll touch. Files move, rows update, decisions land between
tasks. The 60 seconds of doc-reading saves an hour of fixing assumptions
made on stale memory.

Same instinct applies after delegating to a subagent: trust but verify
its summary against the actual files.

## Verify when it makes sense

- **At phase boundaries:**
  `cargo fmt && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo nextest run --workspace`.
- **Whenever a `refactor/*` doc changes:** `refactor/check.sh`. Should be all
  green; warnings are fine; red `✗` means a doc lies.
- **For UI changes:** drive the binary in a tmux side-pane (see
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` → Testing TUI changes).
- **For puml edits:** regenerate the SVG
  (`plantuml -tsvg refactor/tui-ui-architecture-target.puml`).

Don't run all of these on every commit. Run what catches what you just changed.

## Doc sync rule

When a decision is made or the design shifts, update **every** affected doc in
the **same change**. Drifted docs are bugs. `check.sh` catches the mechanical
cases; the human-shaped cases (intent vs structure consistency) need attention.

A phase is not "landed" until `P<n>.md` is written and the affected companion
files are updated.

## Cold-start checklist

1. Read this file.
2. Run `refactor/check.sh` — should be all green.
3. Read `STATUS.md` — orient in 30 seconds.
4. Read the most recent `P<n>.md` to see what just happened.
5. Skim `INVENTORY.md` rows for the upcoming phase.
6. `grep -rn 'TODO' crates tests src` — quick read of code-level deferrals.
   If the count is climbing without phases closing, pause and triage.
7. If anything feels stale, fix the docs before writing code.

## `P<n>.md` template

```md
# P<n> — <phase name>

**Status:** in-progress | done **Started:** YYYY-MM-DD **Landed:** YYYY-MM-DD
(or empty while in-progress)

## What shipped vs what was planned

One sentence per sub-phase, with deviations called out. If a sub-phase slipped
to the next phase, say so and link the row in INVENTORY.md.

## Decisions made while coding

For each non-obvious choice:

- **<short title of the decision>**
  - **Picked:** what we did.
  - **Alternative considered:** what else was on the table.
  - **Why this one:** the deciding factor.

The rule: if you would re-litigate this in `P<n+2>`, write it down.

## Files / types / functions changed

Compact diff-shape summary (INVENTORY.md is the source of truth):

- Added: …
- Deleted: …
- Renamed / moved: …
- Restructured: …

## Deferrals

What was supposed to be in this phase but landed in a later one (with the new
home). Without a clear destination, surface it in STATUS's open questions.

## Verification

- Tree status at end of phase: green | red (with reason).
- Tests run: `cargo nextest run --workspace` result.
- FEATURES.md walk: which rows verified, which still offline.
- Any human parity walk performed.

## Next phase entry conditions

What must be true before `P<n+1>` starts.
```
