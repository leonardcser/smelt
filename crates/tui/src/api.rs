//! Typed mutation surface for app code to drive window + buffer
//! state. Each operation is a named function with clear pre/post-
//! conditions, so call sites read as intent rather than tag dispatch.
//!
//! This mirrors neovim's `vim.api.{nvim_buf_*, nvim_win_*}` split:
//! `buf::*` operates on buffer text; `win::*` on cursor + viewport +
//! selection. The same surface internal code uses is what plugins will
//! eventually use — keep it small, named, and intent-shaped.
//!
//! # Stability
//!
//! Breaking changes to any `pub fn` in this module bump [`VERSION`].
//! User scripts (Lua, Rust plugins) can branch on it to target a
//! specific API generation.
