//! Per-dialog open/close logic for builtin floats. Each file (resume,
//! permissions, ps, rewind, export, help, confirm, agents, lua_dialog)
//! builds its `PanelSpec`s and registers window callbacks that push
//! `AppOp`s on Submit / Dismiss / custom keymaps. State shared across
//! callbacks lives in `Rc<RefCell<_>>`, captured by the closures.
