//! Per-dialog open/close logic for builtin floats. Each file (resume,
//! permissions, ps, help, confirm, agents, lua_dialog) builds its
//! `PanelSpec`s and registers window callbacks that push `AppOp`s on
//! Submit / Dismiss / custom keymaps. State shared across callbacks
//! lives in `Rc<RefCell<_>>`, captured by the closures.
