//! Per-dialog open/close logic for builtin floats. Each file (resume,
//! permissions, confirm, agents, lua_dialog) builds its `PanelSpec`s
//! and registers window callbacks that push `AppOp`s on Submit /
//! Dismiss / custom keymaps. State shared across callbacks lives in
//! `Rc<RefCell<_>>`, captured by the closures.
