//! Per-dialog state owned by `App`. Each file implements one builtin
//! float (resume, permissions, ps, rewind, export, help) as a struct
//! that carries its domain state and implements `DialogState`.
//!
//! Dispatch: `events.rs` keeps `App::float_states: HashMap<WinId,
//! Box<dyn DialogState>>`. On every intercepted key / select / dismiss
//! we take the state out of the map, call its method with `&mut App`,
//! then put it back if the dialog is still open.
