//! Typed effect ops applied by the app reducer.
//!
//! `AppOp` is the single funnel for deferred state mutations. Lua
//! handlers and Rust dialog callbacks both queue ops into the same
//! channel; the app drains them each tick and dispatches through
//! `App::apply_ops`. One reducer, one mutation log.
//!
//! Ops partition into two buckets:
//!
//! - **`UiOp`** — pure compositor / buffer / window primitives plus
//!   ephemeral UI state (notifications, ghost text). No engine calls,
//!   no app-state mutation beyond the ui layer. Safe to apply in any
//!   order with respect to domain effects as long as the ui dispatch
//!   is ordered among itself.
//! - **`DomainOp`** — app-state mutations, engine commands, session
//!   lifecycle, permission + agent + process control, tool resolution.
//!   These reach into the agent loop, persistence, or the Lua runtime.
//!
//! Handlers push into the shared queue via `Into<AppOp>`: callers
//! write `ops.push(UiOp::BufCreate { id })` or `ops.push(DomainOp::
//! LoadSession(id))` and the queue stays a single ordered stream so
//! the reducer can apply ui + domain effects in the exact sequence a
//! handler emitted them.
