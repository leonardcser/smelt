//! Unified buffer abstraction shared by the prompt (writable) and the
//! content pane (readonly). A `Buffer` owns text + cursor + selection +
//! vim + kill-ring + undo + viewport state, and exposes a single set of
//! methods for key handling, mouse clicks, and scroll — so both panes
//! route through the same code path regardless of whether they can be
//! edited.
//!
//! The content pane refreshes `buf`/`cpos` each time from the rendered
//! transcript before dispatching, since the transcript is recomputed
//! every frame. Writable buffers persist their content across calls.
