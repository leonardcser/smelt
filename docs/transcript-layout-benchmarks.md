# Transcript layout benchmarks

Run the transcript layout benchmark suite through xtask:

```bash
cargo xtask bench-transcript-layout --runs 5
```

The command runs ignored `smelt-tui` benchmark tests in release mode and prints:

- one sample line per workload/run;
- a mean±standard-deviation table for projection/cache workloads;
- structural counters for layout compilation, exact height measurement, and
  visible materialization;
- app-level navigation/search timings for `/`, Ctrl-D, Ctrl-U, `gg`, and `G`
  over a warmed transcript unless `--skip-nav` is passed.

Useful variants:

```bash
# Run only the 10 MiB mixed workload.
cargo xtask bench-transcript-layout --runs 10 --workloads mixed_10mib

# Run the 50 MiB mixed workload without the navigation suite.
cargo xtask bench-transcript-layout --runs 1 --workloads mixed_50mib --skip-nav

# Run a comma-separated subset.
cargo xtask bench-transcript-layout --runs 5 --workloads markdown_4mib,tool_output_4mib

# Debug/test profile for instrumentation work; do not use for timing baselines.
cargo xtask bench-transcript-layout --debug --runs 1 --workloads mixed_10mib
```

Current projection workloads:

- `mixed_10mib`: representative mixed transcript with user, assistant markdown,
  thinking, exec, and tool blocks.
- `mixed_50mib`: same shape at 50 MiB for large-resume/projection investigation;
  prefer `--runs 1 --skip-nav` while iterating because a 5-run sample is long.
- `markdown_4mib`: markdown-heavy assistant content with tables, code fences,
  quotes, and wrapping pressure.
- `tool_output_4mib`: many completed tool calls with long raw output bodies.
- `tiny_blocks_1mib`: many small heterogeneous blocks to expose per-block
  overhead.
- `huge_blocks_4mib`: few very large markdown/preformatted blocks to expose
  per-block measurement cost.

The app-level navigation/search benchmark uses an 8,000-block warmed transcript
and reports:

- `/needle-target` search submission plus redraw;
- `/common-token` submission and 100 `n` result jumps plus redraws;
- append-then-search timing for incremental search-index invalidation;
- 20 Ctrl-D half-page moves plus redraws;
- 20 Ctrl-U half-page moves plus redraws;
- `gg` plus redraw;
- `G` plus redraw;
- sparse/resumed 80-key burst scroll timings without scroll trace enabled,
  reported with the `prod_burst_*` prefix;
- sparse/resumed 80-key burst scroll timings with scroll trace enabled, reported
  with the `burst_*` prefix for diagnostic projection-frame counters;
- sparse/resumed search submission and 100 `n` result jumps, reported with the
  `sparse_*` prefix.

The xtask command forces `--test-threads=1` so global perf/allocation counters
and CPU contention from the projection and navigation suites do not contaminate
each other. Each benchmark also runs one unreported warmup sample before
collecting reported runs. Pass `--skip-nav` when investigating large projection
workloads where navigation/search is unrelated noise.

Use release numbers for decisions. Use the counters to identify algorithmic
changes: scroll/visible/full-cache paths should not compile layouts or remeasure
exact block heights, while no-cache cold projection should compile and measure
every block.
