### Goals and auto-continue

`/goal <objective>` creates an auto-continuing goal and immediately asks the
agent to pursue it. `/goal set <objective>` is equivalent. An unfinished goal
must be completed or cleared before another can be created.

| Form | Effect |
| ---- | ------ |
| `/goal` or `/goal status` | Show objective, state, progress, id, and auto-continue state |
| `/goal progress <label>` | Set the durable progress label shown in the goal bar |
| `/goal summary <label>` | Set a shorter stable goal-bar summary |
| `/goal pause` | Pause the goal and disable its auto-continue |
| `/goal resume` | Reactivate the goal, enable auto-continue, and schedule continuation |
| `/goal block [reason]` | Mark the goal blocked and disable auto-continue |
| `/goal done` | Mark the goal complete and disable auto-continue |
| `/goal clear` | Remove the goal from the session |
| `/goal auto on`, `/goal auto off` | Enable or disable auto-continue; this also activates or pauses the goal |

Auto-continue runs only while idle. Queued user messages run first. By default,
`smelt.settings.auto_continue = "goal"`, so only active auto goals continue; if
the same goal remains active afterward, auto-continue resumes. When a provider
returns a quota or rate-limit reset time, an eligible auto-continue schedules its
next continue after that reset. Set `smelt.settings.auto_continue = "off"` to
disable idle continuation, or `"always"` to continue any idle session even when
no goal is active.

### Conversation copy

`/copy` copies the latest non-empty conversation message. Pass `N` to copy the
latest N messages in chronological order, or filter first with `--role user` or
`--role assistant` (`-r` also works). Multiple messages include `User:` and
`Assistant:` headers automatically; `--headers` also adds a header to a single
message. `/yank` accepts the same arguments.

### Managed worktrees

Run `/worktree` with no arguments to pick an existing worktree, start creating
one, or view worktree status. `/worktree <name> [--base <ref>]` creates or enters
a managed worktree; `/wt <name> [-b <ref>]` is the short form. Entering a
worktree switches smelt's real process working directory and reloads project
context. See [Managed worktrees](../guide/usage.md#managed-worktrees).

### Fast mode and notifications

`/fast` toggles accelerated provider inference for the current session. Explicit
`on`, `off`, and `toggle` forms are available. The command reports an error
rather than silently changing state when the active model does not advertise
fast-mode support.

`/notify` defaults to `once`, which notifies after the next completed turn.
`on` enables notifications for this session, `off` disables them for this
session, `clear` removes the session override, and `status` reports the effective
mode. Persistent defaults live in `smelt.settings.notifications.turn_end`.

The `/inspect` command comes from the opt-in `smelt.plugins.inspect` plugin. Add
`require("smelt.plugins.inspect")` to `init.lua` to register it.

## Shell Escape

Prefix with `!` to run a shell command directly, without going through the
agent. Output appears inline in the conversation. Shell escapes are useful for
quick checks, such as verifying test output or reading a config value, without
bloating the agent's context window with a full tool call.

```
!git status
!cargo test
```

Shell escapes also work while the agent is running.

## Custom Commands

Create `.md` files in `~/.config/smelt/commands/` and they become prompt-template
slash commands. Their filename is the command name, and their body is sent to the
agent after template expansion. See the
[Customization guide](../guide/customization.md#custom-commands) for an example.

For commands implemented as Lua handlers instead of agent prompts, put a module
under `~/.config/smelt/plugins/` and call `smelt.cmd.register(...)`. Lua handlers
can open UI, mutate runtime state, and invoke other commands; markdown commands
are better for reusable model instructions.

### Shell Execution in Templates

- **Inline**: `` !`command` ``, output replaces the backtick expression
- **Fenced**: ` ```! ` code block, output replaces the block
- **Escape**: `` \!`command` ``, prevents execution
