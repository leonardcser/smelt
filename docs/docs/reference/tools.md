# Tools Reference

## File I/O

### `read_file`

Reads a file and returns its contents with line numbers. Supports text files and
image files (png, jpg, gif, webp, bmp, tiff, svg). Use `offset` and `limit` to
read specific ranges of large files.

### `write_file`

Creates or overwrites a file. In the confirm dialog, a syntax-highlighted
preview of the new content is shown.

### `edit_file`

Applies diff-based edits to an existing file. The confirm dialog shows a
scrollable inline diff (old vs. new).

### `notebook_edit`

Edits Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) cells. Supports replacing, inserting, and
deleting cells. Identify cells by `cell_id` or `cell_number` (0-indexed).

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `notebook_path` | Absolute path to the notebook |
| `cell_number` | 0-indexed cell number (used when `cell_id` is omitted) |
| `cell_id` | Cell ID (takes precedence over `cell_number`; for insert, new cell goes after this cell) |
| `new_source` | New source content (required for replace and insert) |
| `cell_type` | `code` or `markdown` (required for insert, defaults to current type for replace) |
| `edit_mode` | `replace` (default), `insert`, or `delete` |

When reading, cells are displayed as numbered blocks with their type, source
content, and outputs. Supports offset/limit slicing.

## Search

### `glob`

Finds files matching glob patterns (e.g., `**/*.rs`, `src/**/*.ts`). Returns
matching paths.

### `grep`

Searches file contents with regex. Returns matching lines with context.

## Execution

### `bash`

Runs a shell command with streaming output. Each line of stdout/stderr is
streamed to the conversation in real-time.

**Behavior details:**

- Default timeout: 120 seconds (max: 600 seconds)
- Interactive commands are rejected (vim, nano, less, etc.)
- Shell backgrounding (`&`) is rejected — use `run_in_background` instead
- Output is line-buffered (stdout and stderr multiplexed)
- Non-zero exit codes are flagged as errors
- Cancellable via the UI

Set `run_in_background` to `true` to run the command asynchronously. Returns
immediately with a process ID. Use `read_process_output` and `stop_process` to
manage it. Monitor all background processes with `/ps`.

### `read_process_output`

Reads buffered output from a background process. Supports blocking reads with
an optional timeout.

### `stop_process`

Kills a running background process.

## Web

### `web_fetch`

Fetches a URL and extracts content using an LLM. The page is fetched, converted
to the requested format, then an isolated LLM call extracts only what the
`prompt` asks for.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `url` | URL to fetch (required) |
| `prompt` | What to extract from the page (required) |
| `format` | Output format: `markdown` (default), `text`, or `html` |
| `timeout` | Timeout in seconds (default: 30, max: 120) |

**Limits:**

- Response body capped at 5 MB
- Output capped at 2,000 lines or 50 KB (truncation noted)
- Results are cached by URL and format

### `web_search`

Searches the web via DuckDuckGo. Returns results with title, URL, and
description. Results are cached by query.

## Interaction

### `ask_user_question`

Asks you a question with selectable options. Supports single-select and
multi-select modes (up to 4 questions per call). Available in interactive mode
only.

## Knowledge

### `load_skill`

Loads a skill by name to inject specialized instructions and knowledge into the
conversation. Skills are discovered from `~/.config/smelt/skills/*/SKILL.md`,
`.smelt/skills/*/SKILL.md`, and any paths listed in `skills.paths` config.

Each skill directory contains a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`,
`description`) and a markdown body. Skill descriptions appear in the system
prompt so the agent knows what's available. The full content is loaded on demand
when the agent calls this tool.

## Multi-Agent

These tools are only available when `--multi-agent` is enabled.

### `spawn_agent`

Spawns a new subagent to work on a task. Give it a well-scoped task with all
the context it needs. Set `wait` to `true` to block until the agent finishes.
Subagents persist and build context — reuse them via `message_agent`.

### `list_agents`

Lists agents in the current workspace with their name, status, and task slug.
Shows both owned subagents and discovered peers.

### `message_agent`

Sends a message to one or more agents by name. Use to steer subagents, provide
information, or coordinate work.

### `peek_agent`

Inspects another agent's context without interrupting it. Useful for checking
what a subagent knows or is working on.

### `stop_agent`

Terminates a subagent and all its children.

## Mode-Specific

### `exit_plan_mode`

Plan mode only. Called by the agent when its plan is ready for your review.
Takes a required `plan_summary` parameter. The confirm dialog renders the plan
as markdown. Approving switches to Apply mode.
